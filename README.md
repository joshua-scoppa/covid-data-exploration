# covid-data-exploration

I used SQL to extract and analyse data about COVID-19 deaths. Data from Our World in Data: <https://ourworldindata.org/covid-deaths>.

Included in this repository are the SQL file I created, and the two CSV files I used.

Skills used:
- Utilised SQL Server to extract and analyse raw data, gaining valuable insights about COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations around the world.
- Compared COVID-19 deaths and vaccinations data from two different tables using JOIN.
- Discovered national and international COVID-19 trends using aggregate functions such as MAX and SUM.
